Everything required for building the Karaf OpenDaylight RPM.

Note that the currently supported version is Helium SR1.1.

## Building the RPM

The `build.sh` script is a helper for building the RPM. 

```
[fedora@dfarrell-rpm ~]$ ./build.sh 
<snip output of RPM building process>
RPM built!
Should be at: /home/fedora/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/opendaylight-0.2.1-5.fc20.noarch.rpm
```

## Working with the ODL RPM

The familiar RPM-related commands apply to the OpenDaylight RPM.

### Installing OpenDaylight via the RPM

```
# Note that there's nothing in /opt before the install
[fedora@dfarrell-rpm ~]$ ls /opt/
# Note that there are no opendaylight systemd files before install
[fedora@dfarrell-rpm ~]$ ls /usr/lib/systemd/system | grep -i opendaylight
# Install the ODL RPM
[fedora@dfarrell-rpm ~]$ sudo rpm -i /home/fedora/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/opendaylight-0.2.1-5.fc20.noarch.rpm
# Note that ODL is now installed in /opt
[fedora@dfarrell-rpm ~]$ ls /opt/
opendaylight-0.2.1
# Note that there's now a systemd .service file for ODL
[fedora@dfarrell-rpm ~]$ ls /usr/lib/systemd/system | grep -i opendaylight
opendaylight.service
```

The `install.sh` script is a helper for doing the install. Note that the script's path to the RPM may need to be configured.

### Uninstalling OpenDaylight via the RPM

```
# Note that ODL is installed in /opt/
[fedora@dfarrell-rpm ~]$ ls /opt/
opendaylight-0.2.1
# Note that there's a systemd .service file for ODL
[fedora@dfarrell-rpm ~]$ ls /usr/lib/systemd/system | grep -i opendaylight
opendaylight.service
# Uninstall the ODL RPM
[fedora@dfarrell-rpm ~]$ sudo rpm -e opendaylight-0.2.1
# Note that ODL has been removed from /opt/
[fedora@dfarrell-rpm ~]$ ls /opt/
# Note that the ODL systemd .service file has been removed
[fedora@dfarrell-rpm ~]$ ls /usr/lib/systemd/system | grep -i opendaylight
```

## Managing OpenDaylight via systemd

The OpenDaylight RPM ships with systemd support.

### Starting OpenDaylight via systemd

```
[fedora@dfarrell-rpm ~]$ sudo systemctl start opendaylight
[fedora@dfarrell-rpm ~]$ sudo systemctl status opendaylight

## Connecting to the Karaf shell

A few seconds after OpenDaylight is started, its Karaf shell will be accessible.

The `connect.sh` script is provided as an example of how to connect to the Karaf shell.

Additionally, here's an example of connecting manually (password: `karaf`):

```
[fedora@dfarrell-rpm ~]$ ssh -p 8101 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no karaf@localhost
Authenticated with partial success.
